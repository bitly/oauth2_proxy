## OAuth2 Proxy Config File
## https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy

## <addr>:<port> to listen on for HTTP/HTTPS clients
# http-address = "127.0.0.1:4180"
# https-address = ":443"

## TLS Settings
# tls-cert = ""
# tls-key = ""

## the OAuth Redirect URL.
# defaults to the "https://" + requested host header + "/oauth2/callback"
# redirect-url = "https://internalapp.yourcompany.com/oauth2/callback"

## the http url(s) of the upstream endpoint. If multiple, routing is based on path
# upstreams = [
#     "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
# ]

## Log requests to stdout
# request-logging = true

## pass HTTP Basic Auth, X-Forwarded-User and X-Forwarded-Email information to upstream
# pass-basic-auth = true
# pass-user-headers = true
## pass the request Host Header to upstream
## when disabled the upstream Host is used as the Host Header
# pass-host-header = true 

## Email Domains to allow authentication for (this authorizes any email on this domain)
## for more granular authorization use `authenticated-emails-file`
## To authorize any email addresses use "*"
# email-domain = [
#     "yourcompany.com"
# ]

## The OAuth Client ID, Secret
# client-id = "123456.apps.googleusercontent.com"
# client-secret = ""

## Pass OAuth Access token to upstream via "X-Forwarded-Access-Token"
# pass-access-token = false

## Authenticated Email Addresses File (one email per line)
# authenticated-emails-file = ""

## Htpasswd File (optional)
## Additionally authenticate against a htpasswd file. Entries must be created with "htpasswd -s" for SHA encryption
## enabling exposes a username/login signin form
# htpasswd-file = ""

## Templates
## optional directory with custom sign_in.html and error.html
# custom-templates-dir = ""

## skip SSL checking for HTTPS requests
# ssl-insecure-skip-verify = false


## Cookie Settings
## Name     - the cookie name
## Secret   - the seed string for secure cookies; should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes
##            for use with an AES cipher when cookie_refresh or pass_access_token
##            is set
## Domain   - (optional) cookie domain to force cookies to (ie: .yourcompany.com)
## Expire   - (duration) expire timeframe for cookie
## Refresh  - (duration) refresh the cookie when duration has elapsed after cookie was initially set.
##            Should be less than cookie_expire; set to 0 to disable.
##            On refresh, OAuth token is re-validated. 
##            (ie: 1h means tokens are refreshed on request 1hr+ after it was set)
## Secure   - secure cookies are only sent by the browser of a HTTPS connection (recommended)
## HttpOnly - httponly cookies are not readable by javascript (recommended)
# cookie-name = "_oauth2_proxy"
# cookie-secret = ""
# cookie-domain = ""
# cookie-expire = "168h"
# cookie-refresh = ""
# cookie-secure = true
